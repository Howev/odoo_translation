Connector
=========

This is a framework designed to build connectors with external systems,
usually called `Backends`.

Documentation: http://odoo-connector.com

It features:

* A jobs queue

    In which the connectors can push functions (synchronization tasks)
    to be executed later.

* An event pattern

    The connectors can subscribe consumer methods, executed when the events
    are fired.

* Connector base classes

    Called ``ConnectorUnit``.

    Include base classes for the use in connectors, ready to be extended:

    * ``Synchronizer``: flow of an import or export
    * ``Mapper``: transform a record according to mapping rules
    * ``Binder``: link external IDs with local IDS
    * ``BackendAdapter``: adapter interface for the exchanges with the backend

* A multi-backend support

    Each ``ConnectorUnit`` can be registered amongst a backend type (eg.
    Magento) or a backend version only.

It is actually used to connect Magento_ and Prestashop_

EU Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) VAT for telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services
=============================================================================================

As of January 1rst, 2015, telecommunications, broadcasting
and electronic services sold within the European Union
have to be always taxed in the country where the customer
belongs. In order to simplify the application of this EU
directive, the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) registration scheme
allows businesses to make a unique tax declaration.

This module makes it possible by helping with the creation
of the required EU fiscal positions and taxes in order to
automatically apply and record the required taxes.

This module installs a wizard to help setup fiscal positions
and taxes for selling electronic services inside EU.

The wizard lets you select:
 - the EU countries to which you are selling these
   services
 - your national VAT tax for services, to be mapped
   to the target country's tax
 - optionally: a template fiscal position, in order
   to copy the account mapping. Should be your
   existing B2C Intra-EU fiscal position. (defaults
   to no account mapping)
 - optionally: an account to use for collecting the
   tax amounts (defaults to the account used by your
   national VAT tax for services)

It creates the corresponding fiscal positions and taxes,
automatically applicable for EU sales with a customer
in the selected countries.
The wizard can be run again for adding more countries.

The wizard creates a separate Chart of Taxes for collecting the
VAT amounts of the MOSS declaration, so extracting the MOSS
data should be easy.
Look for a Chart of Taxes named ""EU MOSS VAT Chart"" in the
Taxes Report menu (Generic Accounting Report).

Email Templating (simplified version of the original Power Email by Openlabs).
==============================================================================

Lets you design complete email templates related to any OpenERP document (Sale
Orders, Invoices and so on), including sender, recipient, subject, body (HTML and
Text). You may also automatically attach files to your templates, or print and
attach a report.

For advanced use, the templates may include dynamic attributes of the document
they are related to. For example, you may use the name of a Partner's country
when writing to them, also providing a safe default in case the attribute is
not defined. Each template contains a built-in assistant to help with the
inclusion of these dynamic values.

If you enable the option, a composition assistant will also appear in the sidebar
of the OpenERP documents to which the template applies (e.g. Invoices).
This serves as a quick way to send a new email based on the template, after
reviewing and adapting the contents, if needed.
This composition assistant will also turn into a mass mailing system when called
for multiple documents at once.

These email templates are also at the heart of the marketing campaign system
(see the ``marketing_campaign`` application), if you need to automate larger
campaigns on any OpenERP document.

    **Technical note:** only the templating system of the original Power Email by Openlabs was kept.

    * CODA v1 support.

    * Foreign Currency support.
    * Support for all data record types (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9).
    * Parsing & logging of all Transaction Codes and Structured Format
      Communications.
    * Automatic Financial Journal assignment via CODA configuration parameters.

    * Support for multiple statements from different bank accounts in a single
      CODA file.

      the CODA Bank Account configuration records).
    * Multi-language CODA parsing, parsing configuration data provided for EN,
      NL, FR.

The machine readable CODA Files are parsed and stored in human readable format in
CODA Bank Statements. Also Bank Statements are generated containing a subset of
the CODA information (only those transaction lines that are required for the
creation of the Financial Accounting records). The CODA Bank Statement is a
'read-only' object, hence remaining a reliable representation of the original
CODA file whereas the Bank Statement will get modified as required by accounting
business processes.

CODA Bank Accounts configured as type 'Info' will only generate CODA Bank Statements.

A removal of one object in the CODA processing results in the removal of the
associated objects. The removal of a CODA File containing multiple Bank
Statements will also remove those associated statements.

Instead of a manual adjustment of the generated Bank Statements, you can also
re-import the CODA after updating the OpenERP database with the information that
was missing to allow automatic reconciliation.

Remark on CODA V1 support:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In some cases a transaction code, transaction category or structured
communication code has been given a new or clearer description in CODA V2.The
description provided by the CODA configuration tables is based upon the CODA
V2.2 specifications.
If required, you can manually adjust the descriptions via the CODA configuration menu.

Multi-axial varianted product support for OpenERP
=================================================

OpenERP is already supporting a product variants at the core level. But
without this module, variants are only mono-axial. OpenERP indeed uses the product.template
as the model object and the product.variant as the instance variant.
Using this module, you can now easily deal with multi-axial variants.

A product.template, now has a set of dimensions (like Color, Size, anything you want).
For each dimension, a product.template has a set of dimension values (like Red, Green
for the Color dimension). For each dimension, you can accept or not custom dimension
values. Dimensions can be shared between products.

Once the product.template is set up, you can use a 'generator' button that will populate
the space of the variants. You could also choose to populate only some combinations
by hand instead.

Each variant can have an extra price that will be taken into account when computing
the base listed price. Yet to be implemented: a price extra per variant dimension value.
Finally, this module is better used along with the product_variant_configurator which
will help the salesman selecting the appropriate variant in the sale order line
using dimension criteria instead of having to crawl the full space of variants.
The selection can also be done by name if a proper naming convention is adopted.

Gotchas:
Because many OpenERP reports refer only to the product name without taking care of the
variant, we decided it's better that each variant has a different name expliciting
the variant specifics. So we override the product.template#name field and make it
optional while product.product now has a new mandatory name field. This is usualy
transparent as OpenERP modules try to get their properties like name from product.product
and only from product.template if not found on product.product. But at least you
will have been warned.

The generic OpenERP Customer Relationship Management
====================================================

This application enables a group of people to intelligently and efficiently manage leads, opportunities, meetings and phone calls.

OpenERP ensures that all cases are successfully tracked by users, customers and suppliers. It can automatically send reminders, escalate the request, trigger specific methods and many other actions based on your own enterprise rules.

The greatest thing about this system is that users don't need to do anything special. The CRM module has an email gateway for the synchronization interface between mails and OpenERP. That way, users can just send emails to the request tracker.

OpenERP will take care of thanking them for their message, automatically routing it to the appropriate staff and make sure all future correspondence gets to the right place.

Fiscal positions
----------------

When considering taxes to be applied, it is the province where the delivery occurs that matters. 
Therefore we decided to implement the most common case in the fiscal positions: delivery is the 
responsibility of the supplier and done at the customer location.

Some examples:

1) You have a customer from another province and you deliver to his location.
On the customer, set the fiscal position to his province.

2) You have a customer from another province. However this customer comes to your location
with their truck to pick up products. On the customer, do not set any fiscal position.

3) An international supplier doesn't charge you any tax. Taxes are charged at customs 
by the customs broker. On the supplier, set the fiscal position to International.

4) An international supplier charge you your provincial tax. They are registered with your
provincial government and remit taxes themselves. On the supplier, do not set any fiscal 
position.

'tax included' VAT taxes are not managed by the fiscal positions provided by this
module (because it is complex to manage both 'tax excluded' and 'tax included'
scenarios in fiscal positions).

This localisation module doesn't properly handle the scenario when a France-mainland
company sells services to a company based in the DOMs. We could manage it in the
fiscal positions, but it would require to differentiate between 'product' VAT taxes

in l10n_fr; companies that sell services to DOM-based companies should update the
configuration of their taxes and fiscal positions manually.

After installing the library on the OpenERP Server machine, you may need to set
the path to the ``wkhtmltopdf`` executable file in a system parameter named
``webkit_path`` in Settings -> Customization -> Parameters -> System Parameters

If you are experiencing missing header/footer problems on Linux, be sure to
install a 'static' version of the library. The default ``wkhtmltopdf`` on
Ubuntu is known to have this issue.

This module adds a new Report Engine based on WebKit library (wkhtmltopdf) to support reports designed in HTML + CSS.
=====================================================================================================================

The module structure and some code is inspired by the report_openoffice module.

The module allows:
------------------
    - HTML report definition
    - Multi header support
    - Multi logo
    - Multi company support
    - HTML and CSS-3 support (In the limit of the actual WebKIT version)
    - JavaScript support
    - Raw HTML debugger
    - Book printing capabilities
    - Margins definition
    - Paper size definition

Multiple headers and logos can be defined per company. CSS style, header and
footer body are defined per company.

For a sample report see also the webkit_report_sample module, and this video:
    http://files.me.com/nbessi/06n92k.mov

Requirements and Installation:
------------------------------
This module requires the ``wkhtmltopdf`` library to render HTML documents as
PDF. Version 0.9.9 or later is necessary, and can be found at
http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/ for Linux, Mac OS X (i386) and Windows (32bits).

After installing the library on the OpenERP Server machine, you may need to set
the path to the ``wkhtmltopdf`` executable file in a system parameter named
``webkit_path`` in Settings -> Customization -> Parameters -> System Parameters

If you are experiencing missing header/footer problems on Linux, be sure to
install a 'static' version of the library. The default ``wkhtmltopdf`` on
Ubuntu is known to have this issue.

This module allows to use several analytic plans according to the general journal.

For example, you can define the following analytic structure:

  * **Salesman**

      * Fabien

Here, we have two plans: Projects and Salesman. An invoice line must be able to write analytic entries in the 2 plans: SubProj 1.1 and Fabien. The amount can also be split.
 
The following example is for an invoice that touches the two subprojects and assigned to one salesman:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Plan1:**

    * SubProject 1.1 : 50%
    
    * SubProject 1.2 : 50%
    
**Plan2:**
    Eric: 100%

So when this line of invoice will be confirmed, it will generate 3 analytic lines,for one account entry.

The analytic plan validates the minimum and maximum percentage at the time of creation of distribution models.

RIB Bank Accounts can be entered in the ""Accounting"" tab of the Partner form by specifying the account type ""RIB"". 

The four standard RIB fields will then become mandatory:
--------------------------------------------------------    
    - Bank Code
    - Office Code
    - Account number
    - RIB key
    
As a safety measure, OpenERP will check the RIB key whenever a RIB is saved, and
will refuse to record the data if the key is incorrect. Please bear in mind that
this can only happen when the user presses the 'save' button, for example on the
Partner Form. Since each bank account may relate to a Bank, users may enter the
RIB Bank Code in the Bank form - it will the pre-fill the Bank Code on the RIB
when they select the Bank. To make this easier, this module will also let users
find Banks using their RIB code.

The module base_iban can be a useful addition to this module, because French banks
are now progressively adopting the international IBAN format instead of the RIB format.
The RIB and IBAN codes for a single account can be entered by recording two Bank
Accounts in OpenERP: the first with the type 'RIB', the second with the type 'IBAN'.

=========================================================================================================================================

The campaigns are dynamic and multi-channels. The process is as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Design marketing campaigns like workflows, including email templates to
      send, reports to print and send by email, custom actions
    * Define input segments that will select the items that should enter the
      campaign (e.g leads from certain countries.)
    * Run your campaign in simulation mode to test it real-time or accelerated,
      and fine-tune it
    * You may also start the real campaign in manual mode, where each action
      requires manual validation
    * Finally launch your campaign live, and watch the statistics as the
      campaign does everything fully automatically.

While the campaign runs you can of course continue to fine-tune the parameters,
input segments, workflow.

**Note:** If you need demo data, you can install the marketing_campaign_crm_demo

VAT validation for Partner's VAT numbers.
=========================================

After installing this module, values entered in the VAT field of Partners will
be validated for all supported countries. The country is inferred from the
2-letter country code that prefixes the VAT number, e.g. ``BE0477472701``
will be validated using the Belgian rules.

There are two different levels of VAT number validation:
--------------------------------------------------------
    * By default, a simple off-line check is performed using the known validation
      rules for the country, usually a simple check digit. This is quick and 
      always available, but allows numbers that are perhaps not truly allocated,
      or not valid anymore.
      
    * When the ""VAT VIES Check"" option is enabled (in the configuration of the user's
      Company), VAT numbers will be instead submitted to the online EU VIES
      database, which will truly verify that the number is valid and currently
      allocated to a EU company. This is a little bit slower than the simple
      off-line check, requires an Internet connection, and may not be available
      all the time. If the service is not available or does not support the
      requested country (e.g. for non-EU countries), a simple check will be performed
      instead.

Supported countries currently include EU countries, and a few non-EU countries
such as Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Norway or Russia. For unsupported countries,
only the country code will be validated.

base,model,"ir.module.module,description",base.module_auth_ldap,"Adds support for authentication by LDAP server.
===============================================
This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, and
will automatically create OpenERP users for them on the fly.

**Note:** This module only work on servers who have Python's ``ldap`` module installed.

Configuration:
--------------
After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in the
Configuration tab of the Company details. Different companies may have different
LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique
in OpenERP, even across multiple companies).

Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by
simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.
This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master
LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to
authenticate it.

Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting
it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.

For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf
manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.

Security Considerations:
------------------------
Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the OpenERP database, the LDAP server
is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the
password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.

OpenERP does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password
should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).

It is also possible to have local OpenERP users in the database along with
LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).

Here is how it works:
---------------------
    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local OpenERP
      database;
    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local
      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;

As LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local OpenERP database
(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is
queried to do the authentication.

Enabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is
encrypted.

User Template:
--------------
In the LDAP configuration on the Company form, it is possible to select a *User
Template*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users
whenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This
allows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.

**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be
         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting
         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You
         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is to
         login once with a valid LDAP user, let OpenERP create a blank local
         user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this new
         user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its groups

=======================================
With this module when a production order is confirmed, some analytic lines
are automatically generated, in order to estimate the costs of the production
order.

At the same time, the estimated allocation of materials, machinery operators
and costs will be made.

In materials case, an analytic line will be generated for each material to
consume in the order. For operators imputation in each operation, it will
be generated one line, so that the number of lines will be equal to the number
of operators in the operation. In machines case, there will be created two
analytic lines for each operation in the associated routing, one per hour cost
and the other per cycle cost.

It has also created the new menu option ""Fictitious Manufacturing Orders to
estimate costs"". When a new MO is created and the new field ""active"" is equal
to false, the MO will be considered as a fictional MO, what with can not be
confirmed, and only is valid to estimate costs. To estimate costs will have to
press the ""Compute data"" button in tab ""Work Orders"". These fictitious MO will
have a different sequence.
From the product form may create a fictitious MO.

-----------------------------------------------------------

In 'product.template' object new field 'Variant reference mask' is added

In 'product.attribute.value' object new field 'Attribute Code' is added.

When creating a new product template without specifying the 'Variant reference
mask', a default value for 'Variant reference mask' will be automatically
generated according to the attribute line settings on the product template.
The mask will then be used as an instruction to generate default code of each
product variant of the product template with the corresponding Attribute Code
(of the attribute value) inserted. Besides the default value, 'Variant
reference mask' can be configure to your liking, make sure puting Attribut Name
inside '[]' mark. 

Example:

Creating a product named 'A' with two attributes, 'Size' and 'Color'::

   Product: A
   Color: Red(r), Yellow(y), Black(b) #Red, Yellow, Black are the attribute
          value, 'r', 'y', 'b' are the corresponding code
   Size: L (l), XL(x)
   
The automatically generated default value for the Variant reference mask will
be `[Color]-[Size]` and then the 'default code' on the variants will be
something like `r-l` `b-l` `r-x` ...

If you like, you can change the mask value whatever you like. You can even have
the attribute name appear more than once in the mask such as ,
`fancyA/[Size]~[Color]~[Size]`, when saved the default code on variants will be
something like `fancyA/l~r~l` (for variant with Color ""Red"" and Size ""L"")
`fancyA/x~y~x` (for variant with Color ""Yellow"" and Size ""XL"").

when the code attribute is changed, it automatically regenerates the 'default
code'.
","Product Variant Default Code(product_variant_default_code)
-----------------------------------------------------------

In 'product.template' object new field 'Variant reference mask' is added

In 'product.attribute.value' object new field 'Attribute Code' is added.

When creating a new product template without specifying the 'Variant reference
mask', a default value for 'Variant reference mask' will be automatically
generated according to the attribute line settings on the product template.
The mask will then be used as an instruction to generate default code of each
product variant of the product template with the corresponding Attribute Code
(of the attribute value) inserted. Besides the default value, 'Variant
reference mask' can be configure to your liking, make sure puting Attribut Name
inside '[]' mark. 

Example:

Creating a product named 'A' with two attributes, 'Size' and 'Color'::

   Product: A
   Color: Red(r), Yellow(y), Black(b) #Red, Yellow, Black are the attribute
          value, 'r', 'y', 'b' are the corresponding code
   Size: L (l), XL(x)
   
The automatically generated default value for the Variant reference mask will
be `[Color]-[Size]` and then the 'default code' on the variants will be
something like `r-l` `b-l` `r-x` ...

If you like, you can change the mask value whatever you like. You can even have
the attribute name appear more than once in the mask such as ,
`fancyA/[Size]~[Color]~[Size]`, when saved the default code on variants will be
something like `fancyA/l~r~l` (for variant with Color ""Red"" and Size ""L"")
`fancyA/x~y~x` (for variant with Color ""Yellow"" and Size ""XL"").

when the code attribute is changed, it automatically regenerates the 'default
code'.

This module creates a check in categories and an option in product templates,
so that it does not create the product variants when the attributes are
assigned. This is used by those modules that create the product when it is
estrictly necessary.

===================================

This module provides a generic infrastructure for quality tests. The idea is
that it can be later reused for doing quality inspections on production lots
or any other area of the company.

Definitions
-----------

* Question: The thing to be checked. We have two types of questions:

 * Qualitative: The result is a description, color, yes, no...

 * Quantitative: The result must be within a range.

* Possible values: The values chosen in qualitative questions.

* Test: The set of questions to be used in inspections.

* Once these values are set, we define the inspection.

We have a *generic* test that can be applied to any model: shipments,
invoices or product, or a *test related*, making it specific to a particular
product and that eg apply whenever food is sold or when creating a batch.

Once these parameters are set, we can just pass the test. We create a
new inspection, selecting a relationship with the model (sale, stock move...),
and pressing ""Select test"" button to choose the test to pass. Then, you must
fill the lines depending on the chosen test.

The complete inspection workflow is:

    Draft -> Confirmed -> Success
                |
                | -> Failure (Pending approval) -> Approved

Based on the nan_quality_control_* modules from NaN·tic.

this customer added in the customer tab of the products.

This can be done thanks to *product_supplierinfo_for_customer module*, that
allows to set customers for each product.

The restriction can be set by default for each partner, and it's propagated
to their sale orders, but it can be change for each order if you want.
